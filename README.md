Blackjack Game
link to my project: https://git.generalassemb.ly/egorkrylov/Project1

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for my project. I started off by creating and html files with a header and deck buttons for two players, I also added a score paragraph and two more buttons to check the score, and to reset the game. I then worked in JS and DOM to create functions to draw a random card when a deck button is clicked, and increament the score equal to a card that's drawn. I also made if statements and for loops to count the score and print out a winning statement when the game is over. I then worked in css to make all the items line up and make the game flashy.

I have two players in my game that play the game of Blackjack or 21. If a player gets 21 points he or she wins the game. If they get more that 21 points they are out of the game. 

When I fist started working on my game I tried using API for the deck of cards but ran into some issues and ended up creating my own deck of cards. I also ran into a problem when I wanted my players to keep their current score if they didn't want to draw another card, I could not figure out how to count the score, so I createad a button to count the score. I also had some minor issues with CSS, where I wasn't able to line up my cards, and with the help of one of the instuctors I created two divs for each player, and everything worked.
